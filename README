Nice Dog

Nice Dog is a nano web framework for PHP, like web.py for Python, Sinatra or Camping for Ruby
Minimal

require 'NiceDog.php';
R('')->controller('test')->action('index')->on('GET');
class Test extends C{
    public function index(){
        echo 'Hello';
    }
}
run();

But Why?

If you want to build a small site or software and do not need a BIG framework with a lot of features, you can use Nice Dog. Nice Dog do not have any ORM or big features like Cake, Rails or Django have, but it is smaller, easier and faster!

Just 2 files

Get beta2.2 here .htaccess and NiceDog.php *Routes Fixed
Easy to deploy

Just drop the files into a folder in your Apache server!
Nice Urls

R('')->controller('test')->action('index')->on('GET');

Tutorial for who doesn't have time

   1. Get the files
   2. Put in your directory, like /var/www/htdocs/, no yaml, xml, *ml
   3. Create a index.php
   4. Just

      require('NiceDog.php')

   5. Make urls like this, define the url, class, method and HTTP method:

      R('tag/(?P<tag>[-\w]+)')->controller('Test')->action('p_tag')->on('GET');

   6. Write a class that extends C

      class Test extends C{}

   7. Write a method p_tag

      public function p_tag($tag){ echo $tag; }

   8. And

      run()

   9. Open in your browser: http://localhost/tag/dog

Templates

PHP works nice for templating, so lets use it!

public function p_tag($tag){
    $this->tag = $tag; 
    $this->render('views/index.php');
}

Base layout
views/layout.php

<h1>My firs example</h1>
<?=$content?>

*To change base layout do this: $this->layout="MyLayout.php"
Template
views/index.php

<span><?=$tag?></span>
